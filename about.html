		<h1>About Krusty Krab</h1>

		<div class="about-text">
			<p>The secret to success is much like the secret to making a better pizza - the more you put into it, the more you get out of it. Our pizza family is as hungry for perfection today as we were when we first opened our doors more than 30 years ago. And we're driven to be the best at making innovative new products and recipes.</p>

			<p>Quality is at our core. It’s the foundation we started with, from the first Krusty Krab pizza that was made under the sea in a burger joint to now more than 5,000 locations in 45 countries and territories around the world.</p>

			<p>We don’t use cheap and more processed ingredients. Whether it's our signature sauce, toppings, our original fresh dough, or even the box itself, we invest in our ingredients to ensure that we always give you the finest quality pizza.</p>

			<p>For you, it’s not just a better pizza. It’s a family gathering, memorable birthday, work celebration or simply a great meal. It’s our goal to make sure you always have the best ingredients for every occasion.</p>
